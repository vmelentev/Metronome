This is a simple Metronome I made in React Native which allows the user to set a metronome with a specified BPM and selected time signature.

Due to the project using Async functions, this app may not work well on some devices and you may hear the metronome tick at uneven time intervals or skip ticks entirely. The app seems to work better using an Android emulator.
